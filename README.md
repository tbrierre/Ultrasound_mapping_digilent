# Ultrasound_mapping_digilent
This repository contains Javascript codes for Digilent Analog Discovery 3 to monitor an ultrasound mapping setup. 

The code waits for a trigger from an arduino Uno that monitor stepper motors and then send a pulse to tFus transducer and a gate signal to the amplifier. At the same time, it measures the signal from the hydrophone. and save it.
